### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github.

I specialize in designing and developing mobile applications that encourage positive behavior change.

Interests inculde:
React, Swift, Machine Learning, NLP and Brain/Bio technology.
Yes, that is a wide range of interest but they are all a means to help humans be more helpful to each other and the environment.

I have experience developing specialized ecommerce experiences.
My latest work involved deploying Reaction Commerce with item configuration features.
This was deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

I have a keen intrest in the abstract idea of connections and graphs. On a higher level of abstraction, graphs allow us to organize and find insight in large amounts of data. On a more concrete level, graph databases have been part of my ecommerce projects.

I have a fasincation with programming languages. Specifically the Lisp family of languages. More generally with the design and trade offs which ultimately lead to the language's user experince.

I also enjoy functional programming and types. Those both allow me to create safer and easier to maintain code.

My favorites text editor is Emacs but I also enjoy modal editors like Vim. Ultimately I like to combine each of them, whether that be through Spacemacs or custom configurations such as with Hammerspoon.

I also have an interest in mathematics and physics. I find beautiful that equations can describe the world quite accurately and belive that computers can help us understand not just the physical world but also the world of mathematics.
